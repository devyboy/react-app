# react-app (Work In Progress)
My first attempt at a web app using React

## Installation
**1**. Clone the repository and install the required node modules.

   `git clone https://github.com/devyboy/react-app.git && cd react-app && npm install`

**2**. Run the app. It should run a package manager and open the app in your web browser. 

   `npm start`
